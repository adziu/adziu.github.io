# So I've been reading Shape Up by Bandcamp team
https://basecamp.com/shapeup

## There are similarities
1. Out of scope
2. Derisking assumptions
3. 

## I've been convinced about those issues:
1. POs do not think about the cost and other constraints when designing
1. TechLeads bet on very rough ideas
1. The strategy is a silent war of Product Owners, not a collaborative path
1. We do not have a clean slate
1. Cycles are too short and we are wasting momentum on 2-weekly reviews
